# Homework M1: Local Storage and Additional Techniques
Main goal is to build further on what was demonstrated during the practice
Prerequisites may vary between different tasks. You should adjust your infrastructure according to the task you chose to implement
Tasks
Chose and implement two or more of the following:
- Create a RAID10-based pool in ZFS out of six devices each 5 GB in size. Do it in two different configurations â€“ 3x2 and 2x3
- Create a RAID6-based pool in ZFS out of five devices each 5 GB in size
- Research on how to use a key file to automount an encrypted volume on boot and demonstrate it for 
*one drive
Please note that even if you choose to implement more than one task, they are quite independent and different. So, you may need to create a separate infrastructure (environment) for each or at least clean it every time*
# Proof
Prepare a document that shows what you accomplished and how you did it. It can include (not limited to):
- The commands you used to achieve the above tasks
- A few pictures showing intermediary steps or results
